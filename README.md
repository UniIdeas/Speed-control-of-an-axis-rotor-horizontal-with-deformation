Automatic Controls Project - Computer Engineering at Alma Mater Studiorum (University of Bologna)

## What is?
This is a university project created for the Automatic Controls course held by Professor Giuseppe Notarstefano at the University of Bologna. :books:

## Abstract
We want to build a controller to obtain an angular velocity Ï‰ that is constant over time despite
the deformation on one of the propeller blades that causes non-linearity.
